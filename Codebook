Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Robert Vroom

Description

This codebook describes variables, data, and transformations performed to clean up data.

Source Data

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The source data for this project can be found here.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

The following files are read into seperate tables from the training and test files

activity_labels.txt
features.txt
subject_train.txt
x_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_test.txt
x_test.txt
y_test.txt

All test and train datasets are merged into a single table using the rbind function in R.
Unneeded variables are removed using the rm function in R to free up memory and streamline the script.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
I use grep to extract these data for the dataset.

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
I merge data subset with the activityType table to inlude the descriptive activity names.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
Used the feature names provided in the activity_labels file

5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Created a single table containing the averages and means.
